# VAL Chatbot

VAL is an AI chatbot that engages users in conversation and saves the chat history in MongoDB. It includes a login and registration system for users, where each userâ€™s conversation history is saved and retrieved during future sessions.

## Features
- **AI-powered Chatbot**: Uses OpenAI API for chatbot interactions.
- **User Login & Registration**: Handles user registration and login with hashed passwords using `bcrypt`.
